# Membrane Framework

Membrane is a versatile multimedia streaming & processing framework. You can use it to build a media server of your need, that can:
- stream via WebRTC, RTSP, RTMP, HLS, HTTP and other protocols,
- transcode, mix and apply custom processing of video & audio,
- accept and generate / record to MP4, MKV, FLV and other containers,
- handle dynamically connecting and disconnecting streams,
- seamlessly scale and recover from errors,
- do whatever you imagine if you implement it yourself :D Membrane makes it easy to plug in your code at almost any point of processing.
